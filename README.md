# Oscilloscope
Simple oscilloscope/logic-analyzer on FPGA with VGA display. Designed for basys2 evaluation board with spartan-3E-100k processor.
Supports probing up to 40Mhz (smooth regulation < ~5Mhz), toggled by slope on selected inputs.

## Inputs
* btn2, btn3 -> select next/prev
* btn1, btn0 -> increase/decrease selected
* pmod JA(0 to 3), JB(0 to 3) -> data inputs
* sw(0 to 7) -> trigger enabled on n-th input

## Project structure

It should be possible to open project/ dir as project in xilinx ISE.
Some of files are autogenerated using python code from generator/, it also
renders something like oscilloscope interface in tkinter.

## Credits

I wrote this project as part of [PUL](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~marpe/pul/) classes at [MIM faculty](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~marpe/pul/), University of Warsaw.
